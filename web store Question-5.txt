A web store uses the following React component for showing suggestions while users are typing product names:


const ProductSearch = (props) => {
  let [name, setName] = React.useState();
  let [suggestions, setSuggestions] = React.useState([]);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if(name !== undefined) {
      props.requestSuggestions(name, setSuggestions);
    }
  }, [name]);
  const onChange = (event) => {
    setName(event.target.value);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor={"search"}>Product name</label>
      <input onChange={onChange} id={"search"} list={"suggestions"}></input>
      <datalist id={"suggestions"}>
        { suggestions.map((suggestion) => <option>{ suggestion }</option>) }
      </datalist>
    </div>
  );
};

a.If the props.requestSuggestions function invokes setSuggestions using [name, suggestions] as the second parameter of React.useEffect, the component will be rerendered after each        
  React.useEffect call.
b.On the first component render, the value of the suggestions variable will be [].
c.If the requestSuggestions function is async and does not call the setSuggestion function immediately, it will throw an error.
d.The function passed to React.useEffect should call ReactDOM.render so that changes to the suggestions variable are visible.
e.If the requestSuggestions function calls setSuggestions with two items, they will be shown in the datalist.
f.Calling setName("10") will make the input field have 10 as its value.

The ProductSearch component provides a user interface for entering a product name and displaying suggestions based on the entered name. It communicates with the parent component through the requestSuggestions prop to update the suggestions based on the user's input.
